    <h1>Yelp! Businesses Over Time</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <p>
            Just a few years ago, we would never have thought that we would be asking total stranger on the internet their
            reconditions on restaurants, hotels, stores, pet services, etc. But, with the our growing dependency on our
            smartphones in general, and the apps within them in specificity, that is exactly what is happening. Over the
            past couple of years, there have been many different apps that were developed for different business
            recommendations across the US, but, Yelp has become one of the forth runner of this particular app style.
            “Yelp it” has become a phrase that we all use in our daily lives when faced with the hassle of making a decision
            for what to do or where to go. Yelp has simply become our saving grace and trusted allay even when we travel to a
            country who's language we don't speak.</p>

        <p>
            Those interactive visualizations were done during a D3 class in the Information Design and Visualization MFA
            program in Northeastern University under the mentorship of Siqi Zhu by students Maaria Assami and Xiaxin Chen.
            Both visualizations are based on data published by “Yelp” and aims to explore two things, mapping how review-traffic
            changes within different individual states, along with how Yelp’s famous star ratting changes over the 10 years
            timeframe for each business establishment within those states.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="canvas" id="canvas-1">
        <div class="canvas-1" id="plot">
            <h3>Trends in review traffic</h3>
            <div class="section">
                <p>The first interactive visualization shows the overall trend of how many reviews are being published using the
                    app overtime, and with that, it generally shows how active, or not, those app users are over time. Hovering over
                    a specific moment in time on the line graph will automatically show how active, again or not, all the other
                    states are being in that exact time.</p>

                <p>Noteworthy to mention, the x axis for the different states differ due to the vast differences in review numbers
                    in the different states. Again, the aim of this visualization is to show the overall trend of review traffics,
                    if they are on the rise, or if they are plummeting, etc., and not to compare the exact numbers or reviews in each
                    state. Also, choosing a specific category of businesses from the scroll menu below will help filter the reviews to
                    fit that exact business category, too.
                </p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h4>Its all about the reviews</h4>

        <p>The next visualization aims to explore how Yelp’s famous five star ratings change overtime for each business. First,
            40 random businesses from all over the states are randomly selected for a general view, but, specific state and
            category selection is possible to narrow down the search. Each dot represents the average number of stars that
            business has during that specific year, and hovering over it with the mouse will display the number on the tooltip.</p>
